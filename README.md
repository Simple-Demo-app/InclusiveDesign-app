# InclusiveDesign

This package contains a template for creating native macOS apps with code completely contained in a Swift package. 

An AppFair app must adhere to the following conventions:

 * https://www.SuperTool.app must redirect to https://supertool-app.github.io
 * https://github.com/SuperTool-app/SuperTool-app.git must contain Package.swift
 * The root `App.entitlements` must enforce the Sandbox & the Hardened Runtime
